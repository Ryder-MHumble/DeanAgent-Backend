# Crawler Concurrency Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines concurrency levels for different crawler types
# to optimize resource utilization and prevent system overload.
#
# Two strategies are available:
# 1. grouped: Per-crawler-type concurrency (recommended for mixed workloads)
# 2. fixed: Single concurrency level for all crawler types
#
# Set 'strategy' to either 'grouped' or 'fixed' to enable the desired approach.

# Active strategy: either 'grouped' or 'fixed'
strategy: grouped

# Grouped strategy: Define concurrency per crawler type
# Use this when you have mixed crawler types with different resource requirements
grouped:
  # Static crawlers: lightweight HTTP requests, high concurrency safe
  # Examples: most news sites, blogs with simple parsing
  static: 20

  # RSS crawlers: lightweight, fetch and parse XML feeds, high concurrency safe
  # Examples: RSS feeds, newsfeeds
  rss: 20

  # Dynamic crawlers: heavyweight, require browser instance per crawl
  # Keep lower due to memory/CPU constraints from Playwright instances
  # Examples: JavaScript-heavy sites, interactive content
  dynamic: 8

  # Snapshot crawlers: medium weight, browser snapshot without full page interaction
  # Lighter than dynamic but heavier than static
  # Examples: capturing page state at specific moments
  snapshot: 10

# Fixed strategy: Single concurrency level for all crawler types
# Use this for simpler deployments or when crawler type distribution is unknown
# The default value of 12 is a conservative middle ground for mixed workloads
fixed:
  default: 12
